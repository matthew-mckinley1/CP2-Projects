it were just two lovers
sittin in the car
listenin to blonde
fallin for eachother
pink and orange skies
feelin super childish
no donald glover
missed call from my mother
like where you at tonight
got no alibi
i was all alone
with the love
of my life
she's got glitter for skin
my radiant beam in the night
no i dont need no light
to see you shine
its your golden hour
you slow down time
in your golden hour
we were just two lovers
feet up on the dash
drivin nowhere fast
burnin through the summer
radio on blast
make the moment last
she got solar power
minutes feel like hours
she knew she was the baddest
cant you even imagine
fallin like i did
for the love
of my life
she's got glow on her face
a glorious look in her eyes
my angel of light
i was all alone
with the love
of my life
shes got glitter for skin
my radiant beam in the night
i dont need no light
to see you shine
its your golden hour
you slow down time
in your golden hour
