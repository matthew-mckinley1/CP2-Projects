# Geometry Calculator

## Project Description
---
This is a Geometry Calculator and it uses different classes for different shapes, and it compares the area of those shapes to see which one is bigger. It also allows you to sort shapes by area or perimeter and view detailed information about each shape using a simple, text-based interface.  

## Installation
---
1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
2. Start the `main.py` file, and follow the instructions given to make shapes and compare their areas/perimeters.  

## Execution and Usage
---
This is a terminal-based application. Once you run `main.py`, you'll see a menu-driven system. You can:
+ Create new shapes (Rectangle, Triangle, Circle)
+ Compare the area or perimeter of two shapes
+ Sort all shapes of a type by area or perimeter  

## Used Technologies
---
+ Python - the main programming language used to build the project  

## Current Features
---
+ Create and store multiple shapes
+ Compare the area or perimeter of any two shapes
+ Sort shapes based on area or perimeter
+ Detects squares when a rectangle has equal sides
+ Shows detailed information about each shape

## Author's Info

Matthew McKinley: I started learning how to code in the summer of 2024, starting in Python. The classes that I've taken and the things that I've been taught have helped me know how to code Python pretty well and I've learned a lot of the logic of coding, and I can follow different languages. I think it's a good skill to be able to code, but I don't think I'm going to do this as a profession. You can reach me at my school email: matthew.mckinley@ucas-edu.net
